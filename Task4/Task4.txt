Tips for Writing a Research Paper-(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/tips-for-writing-a-research-paper/)

This article is a clear and short guide that covers the main steps of writing a research paper. I learned useful, practical advice that feels easy
to follow. 

First, it says to pick a real specific problem rather than a vague idea. The topic I select should genuinely interest me and should be something 
that is unsolved or needs improvement.Choosing a clear problem will help me stay focused throughout the writing and also makes the research
more meaningful. 

Another important point was to not copy but to cite sources. It is better to read and understand the idea, then rewrite it in my own words.
This helps to avoid rejection and is also ethical. It also suggests using visuals like charts or diagrams to explain tricky ideas and the visuals
should be labelled.

Another important part of writing a research paper is to follow the recommended structure i.e. Title, Abstract, Introduction, Related work,
Methods, Results, Conclusions. Finally the article encourages revising several times and getting feedback from others to improve clarity and
fix mistakes. It is essential to re-read the paper few times with a fresh mind to correct repetitive or unclear parts.

Reading this blog also made me think about how I can apply these tips in areas in interested in exploring such as machine learning and
cybersecurity issues. Even in my small blog where I have written a few posts on cybersecurity issues, I can see how focusing on real problems and
keeping ideas simple and concise would make my work stronger
